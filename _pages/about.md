I love learning and exploring, and I wanted to create a place that I can document, highlight, and share some of my experiences and lessons learned as I have been fortunate to work on a wide range of mechanical, aerospace, and data science projects.  While I aim to keep this website about my engineering research, interests, and hobbies, I want to maintain a personal approach.

About Me
======
Currently a PhD student in the University of Washington Mechanical Enginering department, I also hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UW.  As an undergrad I took part in a handful of engineering and non-engineering activities through clubs, internships, and other opportunities that all helped me grow as a person.  This includes working on robotics, automotive vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and much more.  The field that I realized I enjoyed the most was fluid dynamics, and thus I proudly call myself one.  Something about the complex Navier-Stokes equations and the numerous unexplained fluid phenomena absolutely fascinate me.  It might be an innate stubbornness to want to know the "truth" but this has always helped drive me to learn.  Overall, I love research and development (R&D).  The process of having a theory, conducting experiments, learning through these experiments, iterating, developing and prototyping a product, and everything that comes with R&D is what gets me up (almost) everyday.  

Many Hats
======
I can only do what I do today because of the many different opportunities that I have had and the experiences with them.  Whether it is automotive structures, robotics, or drones, I've done extensive mechanical design through various computer-aided-design (CAD) softwares including Solidworks, Siemens NX, and Fusion 360.  Equally important, I've arguably done even more mechanical analysis through finite element analysis (FEA) and computation fluid dynamics (CFD).  I traditionally use ANSYS products for all my FEA and CFD but I have experience with Solidworks's FEA features and Siemens Star-CCM+.  Some of you may be reading this only because of my CFD Youtube videos.  While these are just some of the most powerful engineering skills that I have worked on, there's many other hats that I have worn that include because a leader, an advocate, and a friend.  There's only one of me so in reaching some goal of mine, I recognize that it is important to not only use all the engineering skills that I have acquired, but to use the interpersonal skills, too.

Fun Stuff
======
Outside of my engineering work, there's an endless amount of engineering things that I like doing on the side.  Some of these side projects include CNC machining, woodworking, building cool DIY projects, and more.  Isn't CNC machining a bit much for a side project?  Yes, probably but I bought a desktop CNC machining so I machine a lot of aluminum things and wood things right in my living room.  It's actually made me a much better design engineering in terms of being able to design something to be manufactured.  All of these side projects including smart mirrors, arduino systems, mini-robots, have expanded my skillset while allowing me to work on something different.  As a little kid, I loved playing with Legos, and these side projects give me just as much joy, if not more.
